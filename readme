A simple photon mapping based ray tracer developed to support experiments with nearest-neighbour algorithms.

Features:
* Lua scene and view definitions.
* Sphere, plane and triangle mesh primitives.
* Point light sources.

Planned features:
* Rectangular and spherical light sources.
* Shadows.
* Photon mapping.

Maybe someday:
* Textures
